# Aircraft Structures: Photoelastic Analysis of Epoxy Resin Models

## Overview  
This project investigates the **photoelastic behavior of epoxy resin models** with different cross-sectional geometries—specifically **I-sections** and **elliptical sections**—under various loading conditions. Using the principles of photoelasticity, the study visualizes internal stress distributions through fringe patterns when the models are subjected to bending and compression.  
The work highlights the significance of experimental stress analysis for understanding stress concentration zones and material response in structural components relevant to aircraft design.

## Objectives  
- To study stress distribution in epoxy resin models using the **photoelastic technique**.  
- To analyze and compare **I-section** and **elliptical-section** geometries under loading.  
- To understand **stress concentration zones** through fringe pattern observations.  
- To assess the suitability of **epoxy resin** as a photoelastic material for aircraft structural applications.

## Methodology  

### Model Design  
- Two geometries were designed:  
  - **I-section:** Flange width = 150 mm, web height = 150 mm, thickness = 5 mm.  
  - **Elliptical section:** Major diameter = 65 mm, thickness = 5 mm.  
- Models were designed in **SolidWorks** and molds were fabricated using **3D printing** (PLA/ABS).  

### Fabrication Process  
1. **Mold Preparation:** Designed models were printed and treated with a release agent.  
2. **Epoxy Casting:** Resin and hardener were mixed and poured into molds.  
3. **Curing:** Samples were allowed to cure at room temperature for adequate strength and optical clarity.  
4. **Finishing:** Cured samples were removed, cleaned, and polished for photoelastic testing.  

### Experimental Procedure  
- Tests performed included **2-point compression**, **3-point bending**, and **4-point bending**, following **ASTM D790** and **D6272** standards.  
- End-notched samples followed **ASTM D7905** guidelines.  
- The setup involved a **photoelastic bench** equipped with a **polarizer, analyzer, and light source**.  
- Under polarized light, **fringe patterns** were observed and recorded for each model.

## Theoretical Background  

### Photoelasticity Principle  
Photoelasticity is based on **birefringence**, a property where stressed transparent materials exhibit different refractive indices. When viewed under polarized light, this stress-induced birefringence creates **isochromatic fringes** corresponding to regions of equal principal stress difference.

### Stress-Optic Law  
The difference in principal stresses is related to the observed fringe order by:

\[
\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 = \frac{N \cdot \lambda}{t \cdot C}
\]

where:  
- \( N \): Fringe order  
- \( \lambda \): Wavelength of light  
- \( t \): Thickness of the specimen  
- \( C \): Stress-optic coefficient  

This relation enables quantitative stress analysis from experimental fringe patterns.

---

## Results and Discussion  
- **Elliptical section:** Distinct fringe patterns were observed, though minor distortions occurred due to internal stress during demolding.  
- **I-section:** Fringe patterns were less clear due to manufacturing defects and insufficient curing time.  
- The results highlight the **importance of fabrication quality** in photoelastic testing—any imperfections in casting can distort stress visualization.  
- Despite minor challenges, the epoxy resin effectively demonstrated birefringence, validating its use as a **photoelastic material** for stress analysis.

## Conclusion  
The project successfully demonstrated that **epoxy resin** is suitable for visualizing stress distribution through **photoelasticity**.
